        <p>
          Hey - I'm Nathan. I'm a developer living in Halifax, Nova Scotia. I'm
          a father to two huskies and a little boy, a husband to a strong and
          driven wife, and a rugby player. Programming is my passion and I
          consider myself lucky to be able to help businesses solve problems
          every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          My career started in marketing when my wife and I needed someone to
          drive our business forward. Over the next 5 years I developed a
          thorough understanding of everything from building funnels and landing
          pages to interpreting analytics and making hcnages to our digital
          presence based on our data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently I'm working as a developer in a marketing agency, in charge
          of building web solutions for companies on the day to day. I build
          everything from corporate brochure websites to large scale intranet
          tools and reporting systems.
